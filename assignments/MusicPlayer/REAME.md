1) My music app plays songs and shows their full duration.
   You can also skip to the next or previous song, pause, and play again.
   You can also change the app's theme from dark to light.
   Each song has a photo, its title, and its author.

2) I completed Bonus tasks like:
   “Track duration”,
   “Dark Mode”,
   “Artist name”. 

3) I used photos for background for dark and light mode and photos for musics.
   And also i used musics files as mp3.
